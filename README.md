							###-----IMAGE ANALYSIS LIBRARY-----###

The library is found at https://github.com/Clever-Niwagaba/Image-Analysis-Library

There are a few great Image Handlers and Image Processing librarys available out there, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs, 
the need to simply drag a file into my project folder and start coding, a library with straightforward method names so it can be used without searching to much the web or reading a whole insturction manual so 
I created this simple plug and play library. I want to create an Image Handling, Processing and Analysis library so efficient and simple that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Of course, for the time being the library is still under development so still it will not serve all projects since your needs may be different than what the library 
currently supports for you language or even at all . Functions and features will be added in the near future. 
You may also suggest changes. These are very welcome.

This library was built using; 
* Visual Studio
* Net Beans

##---NOTICE---##
This Image Analysis Library can be used by adding to your projects /src folder  the "Image" java class file which is located under the directory.
Adding the the class file will allow you to use all core features and methods without
the added functionality of the subclasses.
The main core provides all needed tools for image processing, analysis, and handling.

Listed below are the features and functionalities of the library.
Some features may be under development. However, most, if not all the basic functions of image processing, analysis and handling have been taken care of in the Image java class.
